# Exam-2021
Exam projects from the exam in 2021 that I did when preparing for my own exam in 2022.

Mission 1. Modern Art Maker (20%)
Here you will create an application where a user will be able to create their own works of art.
1. User specifies width, height, colour, left and top and "box" (<div></div>) is added to the website, i.e. printed to "output-div", possibly in another way if necessary.
2. It prints how many boxes have been added to the website.
3. Also add function to clear all the boxes to be able to start over.
In this assignment, you must comment on the code lines/code blocks/functions. You must explain what the code does.

Mission 2. Drag racing (25%)
Attached is an HTML file called setInterval-eksempel.html. Read and run the code and understand how it works.
In this task, you will simulate a car race. Create the following functionality (it should be fine to expand with 1 and 1 functionality):
1. There are 3 cars on the website. Every 2nd second (setInterval is used for this) each car must drive forward a random distance between 0 and 200 px.
2. When the first car reaches the finish line (700px or above) it must be printed who won and all three cars must stop moving.
3. Make the car race not start until you click a button (you need to add HTML for this as well).

Mission 3. Medieval estate agent (25%)
Attached are 6 photos of medieval buildings. In this task, you will create an application to display them on the website.
You will create an array containing 6 objects (ie 1 object per building). Each building object must have the following information:
- name
- price
- imageName
- category (you can come up with this yourself, but for example "Watchtower", "Barracks", etc.)
The following functionality must be created here:
1. Show all buildings
2. Show the buildings that are within a minimum and maximum price
3. Displaying buildings in a category (including displaying the number of buildings found in the category)
If the user enters invalid values, or has forgotten to fill in/select something, the user must be notified.

Mission 4. Last Mission (30%)
If you work alone: choose 1 of the 3 tasks below.
If you work 2 together: choose 2 different tasks from the 3 tasks below.
If you work 3 together: all 3 tasks must be solved.
The following tasks are fairly open-ended tasks where you can decide a lot yourself regarding functionality.
The tasks to choose from:
1. ATM simulator with at least the following functionality:
a. Must enter the correct pin code to be allowed to withdraw money.
b. The user must start with a balance of NOK 2,000. Users can withdraw NOK 500, 1000, 1500 or 2000. Image of money (attached) is printed for the user.
c. You must be able to see visually (with pictures) how much money the user has, starting with 4,500 notes, and how much money the user withdraws.
2. Memory game: A game to practice your memory. The user is shown a random number. After a few seconds, the number is taken away and the user must enter it. The user receives feedback as to whether it was correct or incorrect, and then receives the next number. You get to know how many right and wrong ones you have.
3. "Learn a language" game: A language learning game where you should be able to learn up to 10 words in a language. Here you can be creative with regard to how
